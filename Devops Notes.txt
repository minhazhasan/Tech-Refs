-----DevOps Notes-----

Why should we care?
----- Faster deployments
----- Fewer service disruption
----- Faster recovery

3 ways - Principles of devops

1. System Thinking

----- Produce production grade application faster.
----- Never passing a known defect to downstream work centers.
----- Never allowing local optimization to create golbal degradation.
----- Always seeking to increase flow.
------------ Continuous Integration
------------ Continuous Deployment

2. Feedback Loops

----- Measure throughput of work through the system.
----- Page load times
----- Am I building the right thing (A/B testing)
----- Metrics (How many requests a server can process, unit tests, KPI)
----- Postmortems/learning reviews (MTTR(Mean time to recover))
----- Understanding and responding to all customers, internal and extenal
----- Shortening and amplifying all feedback loops
----- Embedding Knowledge where we need it

3. Culture Experimentation

----- Continual Experimentation.
----- Allocating time for the improvement of daily work.
----- Creating rituals that reward the team for taking risks.
----- Introducing faluts into the system to increase resilience.
-------- To build resilience and reliability

CAMS - Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing

CAMS - Culture

------ Came from @damonedwards and @botchagalupe
------ Culture eats strategy for breakfast
------ Service ownership
------ Hack events
------ Technical debt grooming
------ Game days
------ Destructive testing
------ Cross functional teams
------ Agile

*** Cons - Cargo Culting
	---- Why we are adapting the culture, we need have goo understanding about that.
